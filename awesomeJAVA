25 lesser-known Java libraries you should try in 2020
Libraries that can significantly help your software development in Java and JVM

25years ago, James Gosling created Java and changed the programming language landscape forever. Unlike many other programming languages, Java enjoyed high popularity and high demand in the industry in its entire lifespan.

Java has a compelling Core library, which offers many basic functionalities. Due to its high popularity, there exists many mature and powerful Java library. As a pragmatic Software developer, I prefer solving business problems. To solve the common or reoccurring problems, I prefer using a mature library instead of reinventing the wheel.

In a previous blog post, I have listed 10 most important third-party Java libraries every Java developers should know:

Top 10 Libraries every Java Developer should know
A curated list of the essential Java libraries in Java and JVM software development
towardsdatascience.com

In this post, I want to introduce 25 additional Java libraries to celebrate Java’s Silver Jubilee. These libraries are mature and can offer a battle-hardened solution to common problems you may face in Java software development.

Please note that I am not including those libraries which I have already listed in my previous post. Also, I am mainly listing libraries and no frameworks here.

1. RxJava
Reactive Extensions (ReactiveX) is a popular software development paradigm to deal with asynchronous and event-driven programming. RxJava is the Java VM implementations of the Reactive Extensions by using Observables. It extends the Observer Pattern to support event-driven programming by adding composable operators on a sequence of events/data in a declarative way. It also hides the low-level complexities like threading, thread-safety, synchronization, and concurrent data structure.

If you want to do reactive programming in Java, it is a must-have library.

2. OkHttp
HTTP is by far the most used Application layer protocol. There are many excellent Java-based HTTP client libraries out there. But OkHttp is the simplest yet powerful HTTP client library in the JVM. It offers fluent and clean API to develop HTTP client in Java.

It also supports some advanced features: Connection pooling, GZIP shrink, response caching, modern TLS features, and many more.

3. MyBatis
In most Software development projects, we need to store data. Although there are many types of data storage, SQL is still the most used data storage type. As a Java developer, we need to match our Java object to the SQL table. One way to achieve the mapping is to use ORM (e.g., Hibernate). But there are many use cases when you want to have full control over the Object-Table mapping (e.g., Performance). In those cases, you can directly use JDBC and write the SQL query. The other way is to use MyBatis to map Java Object to Stored Procedure or SQL statements. It offers both annotation-based or XML descriptor based mapping.

I prefer MyBatis over plain JDBC, especially in larger projects, as it improves the separation of concerns.

4. HikariCP
HikariCP is the second library in this list related to Database. Establishing a JDBC connection is resource expensive. If you create a new connection every time you access the Database and close it once you are done, it can severely impact your application performance. Not to mention that failure to close the connection properly or allowing limitless database connection can crash your application.

Using Connection Pooling means connections are reused rather than created each time a connection is requested. HikariCP is a very fast yet lightweight Database connection pooling in JVM. It is also very reliable and a “zero-overhead” JDBC connection pool.

5. Lombok
In modern days, Java is often criticized as a verbose and bloated programming language. Compared to other popular languages (JavaScript, Python, Scala, Kotlin), a developer needs to write lots of boilerplate code in Java. Although Java has introduced Records in JDK 15 to reduce boilerplate code in Java, it is not an LTS release. Fortunately, a library can already reduce your boilerplate code in Java significantly: Project Lombok. You can generate getters, setters, hashcode, equals, toString, Builder classes by adding a few annotations. Additionally, it offers null pointer check, logger, and many more.

6. VAVR
Java finally released the much-awaited functional programming via Lambda and Streaming in version 8. If you are used to functional programming or want to dive deep into functional programming, you may find Java’s functional programming wanting. Compared to many other functional programming languages (Haskell, Scala), Java is pale. VAVR is a library that can fill the gap of the functional programming features in Java. It provides persistent collections, functional abstractions for error handling, concurrent programming, pattern matching, and much more.

7. Gson
Over the years, JSON has become the de-facto data exchange format. In Java, there also exist several excellent libraries to deal with JSON. One of them is Jackson, which I have covered in my previous article. The other excellent library is Google’s Gson. Unlike Jackson, it is a minimalistic library and only supports JSON. It offers Data Binding, extensive Generic support, flexible customization. One of the major advantage (or disadvantage depending on your liking) of Gson is that it does not need annotation.

8. jsoup
If you are developing your application in Java and need to deal with HTML, you should use jsoup. It is a Java library to work with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for fetching URLs and extracting and manipulating data. It implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification and parses HTML using the best of HTML5 DOM methods. It supports parsing HTML from URL/string, find and extract data, manipulate the HTML elements, clean HTML, output HTML.

9. JIB
If you are working on an enterprise-grade application, it should be at least Cloud-ready. The first step to make your application cloud-ready is to containerize your application, i.e., put your artifactory binary into Docker image. Dockerizing a Java application is a bit tedious work: you need to have deep knowledge of Docker, you need to create a Dockerfile, and you will need Docker Daemon. Fortunately for the Java developers, Google has created an Open-source Java containerizer using already existing tools. You can use JIB as a Java library to build an optimized Docker and OCI image.

10. Tink
Tink is yet another handy Java library in this list from Google. Cryptography and security are becoming increasingly more important in Software Development. Cryptographic techniques are used to secure user data. Implementing cryptography correctly requires a lot of expertise and effort. A group of Cryptographers and security engineers in Google has written the multi-language cryptographic library Tink. It offers easy-to-use but hard to misuse security API. Tink offers cryptographic functionalities via different primitives. It provides symmetric key encryption, streaming symmetric key encryption, deterministic symmetric key encryption, digital signature, hybrid encryption, and many other encryption functionalities.
