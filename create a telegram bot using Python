Step 1: Set up your Bot’s profile
To set up a new bot, start the conversation with BotFather (@BotFather).
BotFather will help us in creating the new bot.

Search for @botfather in Telegram.

Step 2: Coding the bot
Open up the terminal and start by creating a new directory first.

mkdir echo-bot/
cd echo-bot/
We will be using pipenv virtual environment. Make sure that you have pipenv installed in your system.

Pipenv is a dependency manager for Python projects.

We will be using python-telegram-bot package for interacting with Telegram API. Install the package using the following command.

pipenv install python-telegram-bot
Create a new file bot.py and paste the following code in it.

#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# This program is dedicated to the public domain under the CC0 license.

"""
Simple Bot to reply to Telegram messages.

First, a few handler functions are defined. Then, those functions are passed to
the Dispatcher and registered at their respective places.
Then, the bot is started and runs until we press Ctrl-C on the command line.

Usage:
Basic Echobot example, repeats messages.
Press Ctrl-C on the command line or send a signal to the process to stop the
bot.

Replace “TOKEN” on line 56 with the token that you got from the BotFather earlier.

This code uses polling approach to check for messages and will reply to every message it receives with the same message. You can read more about how python-telegram-bot works here - Coding your first bot

Run the bot using

pipenv run python bot.py
